telegram bot to track available units during bto selection

This project was created when my fiance and I were selecting our BTO unit to help other couples track the avaiable BTO units for selection.

It garnered over a hundred users over the span of 2 weeks.

Features of this bot included:

1. Allowing users to subscribe to the service.
2. Allowing users to schedule alerts at certain timings and for specific blocks.
3. Send interface to users which differentiated available and selected units at the point in time.
